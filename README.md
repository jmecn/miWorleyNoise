miWorleyNoise
=============

2D and 3D Worley noise / Voronoi noise shader for mental ray. Tested with Maya 2012-2015 and the corresponding mental ray versions.

`Voronoi` contains a prototype implementation in Haskell. It is somewhat slow.

`shader` contains the mental ray implementation, including a README on how to compile and use the shader and a makefile for OS X.

To-Do
-----
- Recursive/multi-level implementation
